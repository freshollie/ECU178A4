# ECU178A4

## About
Project completed March 2016.

ECU178 was a module we completed in semester 2 of ours first year on Computer Science at Coventry University.

The Specification for the project was to produce a simulation of a robot that does some sort of search to find the best items. We chose to use a graph best path finding algorithm (Specifically the traveling salesman algorithm)

## How it works

The robot uses a recursive algorithm for find the best path to all the shops that it needs to visit around the town. The town is randomly generated.

The items are selected using a gui item selector

## Other used libraries

The project output was written in pygame with a wrapper that I wrote called "DisplayDriver" (http://www.github.com/freshollie/DisplayDriver) to help with displaying anything on the screen.
